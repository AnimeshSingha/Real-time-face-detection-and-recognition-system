# Real-Time Face Detection And Recognition System
Hello Everyone this is Animesh Singha, Student of Rangamati Science and Technology University pursuing my Bsc engineering in Computer Science This is one of my project's in Digital Image Processing Python Developement field which i have created,basically with Python Based on Student’s Attendance System that uses the property of Real-Time Face Detection And Recognition .
How to execute the program
1.	Install pycharm IDE, python 3.7
2.	Create your own  firebase account for database and storage
3.	Make a json file for database and copy the link from storage
4.	Change database url and storage bucket from the firebase generated link
5.	Execute the program
## Library Requirements	pip install cmake
	pip install dlib
	pip install face-recognition
	pip install cvzone
	pip install opencv-python==4.5.4.60
For More Details or Any Suggestions you can Reach me at animeshsingha1497@gmail.com ** 
## HERE ARE SOME PREVIEWS OF MY APPLICATION
Student Features Student will come and show their faces to the webcam. Then the Real-Time Face Detection And Recognition System program will check the image by checking the given databases that given earlier and find the possible matching person by comparing the given image and database. While a student match with the database his details are shown as per the above image and show his some informations that inputed earlier to database.
Working Process:  Setting up Webcam > Inputting Images >  Detect Face with given images > Face Preprocessing  >  Face Encoding  >  Database Setup  > Add Data to Database (Firebase) >  Add Images to Database (Firebase) >  Real Time Database  >  Output Visualization
Please Checkout my Project of Real-Time Face Detection And Recognition System to implement the code and execute the program properly.
